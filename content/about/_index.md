# Hi, I'm Mark!

I am a passionate technologist who loves to work with domain experts to discuss requirements, understand problems deeply, and provide creative and efficient solutions. 

Highly technical, but always with an eye on the true goals of a project, I'm happy to start working from a blank canvas with architectural sketches on a whiteboard, through consideration of the scalability, performance and security of a solution, all the way down to the nuts and bolts of an implementation itself.

### Lead Developer / Team Lead 
##### Feb 2019 - Jun 2022
Acqui-hired together with the software assets from Gridarrow. Responsible for global roll out of Gridarrow onto on-prem Kubernetes infrastructure. 

Worked closely with most trading desks (equity, fixed-income, FX, crypto) to maximise the value from the Gridarrow platform. 

Managed a team of developers building a wide range of tooling on the Gridarrow platform - from market data and position feeds, to an RFQ platform for crypto options and a FIX order entry system for a global dealer-sweep matching engine.

Integrated Gridarrow core Python library with various data sources, including Kafka, Hazelcast, reference data and other APIs.

Architect and developer for a next generation real-time risk engine, built with Materialize, dbt, Kafka and Debezium, and integrating proprietary data with vendor data feeds from Bloomberg and MSCI. 

Created Kafka to TimescaleDB data pipeline for post-trade analytics by quant and trading users.

### Co-Founder, CEO
##### Jul 2017 - Feb 2019

Co-founded and bootstrapped Gridarrow - "The missing server for Excel" - a multi-tenant cloud-native platform for streaming real-time data into Excel spreadsheets, built using Python, C#, Golang, Angular, Kubernetes and Istio, running on Google Cloud Platform.

The sales pitch was as follows: The Gridarrow platform consists of an Excel Add-in which connects to Python Apps running in the cloud. The Python Apps grab data from anywhere you need - APIs, databases, web-scraping and push it directly to the Excel spreadsheet in real-time. Multiple users can connect their spreadsheets to the same App at the same time and get the same data instantly.

In addition to the growth hacking and customer support required for a bootstrapped startup, I was responsible for the overall system architecture and development of the system, including components such as:

- Python core library: user friendly API for sending data to Excel and streaming gRPC server (later converted to AsyncIO).
- C# Excel add-in using Excel DNA and Reactive Extensions.
- Kubernetes operators (Golang) for control of Gridarrow CRDs, Kubernetes and Istio resources.
- Authn/Authz using OpenID Connect via Auth0 and Istio security policies.

The company's intellectual property was acquired by Flow Traders 1.5 years after founding.
