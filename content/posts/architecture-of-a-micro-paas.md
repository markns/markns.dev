# What is a micro PaaS?

The world is a complicated place, and communicating clearly is hard.
For all the beauty of music and dance, neither has the ability to convey information as precisely as human language.
Sure, there's few better expressions of romantic love than Percy Sledge's [When a Man Loves a Woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYb84BDMbi0), or more convincing statements of intergalactic dominance than an enthusiastic performance of [the Hammer dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keAhk3Lz6E8&t=34s).
But if you need to give someone directions to the railway station, or explain the poor numbers of the sales unit in the quarterly report, you're _probably_ better off using a human language rather than humming or interpretive dance. 

As it is with human to human communication, so it is with human to computer communication.
Point and click user interfaces, and low-code platforms are extremely capable these days. 
And who would argue against the spreadsheet being the most important software application of all time (ok, web-browsers we see you, please sit down).
However, in some scenarios, when we need to direct a computer in precisely the manner we desire, there is no substitute for the expressiveness and fidelity of a programming language.

Learning some basic programming is not that hard. 
A language like Python has a syntax similar to English, with a huge amount of resources to help beginners get coding.
Learning the entire discipline of software engineering, on the other hand, can be a life's work.
Concerns such as security, monitoring, version control, build systems, dependency management, deployment, resource isolation ([and moar!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement#Examples)) can easily turn one hour of coding into months of enterprise bureaucracy.
